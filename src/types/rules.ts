 * rules have produced a verdict.
 *
 * The rule is handed the difference under construction, so `type` is the verdict the rule before it left
 * and `description` is not computed yet. `customScope` carries the scope elements of the route the
 * difference was reached through: routes that disagree about an element reach separate difference
 * instances, which is what lets a rule answer for one route and leave the other alone.
 * The difference is whatever its action makes it, so narrow on `action` before reading a field: a rename
 * carries `beforeKey` and `afterKey` but no `beforeValue`, and an addition carries no declaration paths on
 * the before side.
 * Returns
 * a diff type to replace that verdict with.
 * `undefined` to leave it as it stands, which is also what a rule that throws leaves behind.
